I am happy to present you my course – Selenium – advance, level 2. 
This is next part of learning path related to Selenium WebDriver. I am not going to explain Selenium details, that’s way my recommendation is take following Sii courses before you start this course:  

    1.	Mateusz Tadla/ Introduction to Selenium Basic
    2.	Mateusz Tadla/ Selenium advanced

Mateusz in excellent way have described basic and more advanced Selenium WebDriver details. I want to extend that course and deliver additional project. 

The project contains following items:
    1.	Cucumber framework
    2.	Java v.11
    3.	Maven
    4.	Selenium WebDriver
    5.	Hamcrest Matchers
    6.	JUnit
    7.	Log4J
    8.	Cluecumber

This simple BDD test framework operates on web page: http://5.196.7.235/
I have prepared following scenarios:
    1.	Test scenario – where I want to present basic Cucumber functions
    2.	Login scenario – where I want to login to user account
    3.	Purchase scenario – where I want to order men’s Tshirt.
