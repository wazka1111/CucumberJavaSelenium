# Selenium advanced - Cucumber + JAVA
I am happy to present you my course – Selenium – advance, level 2. 
This is next part of learning path related to Selenium WebDriver. I am not going to explain Selenium details, that’s way my recommendation is take following Sii courses before you start this course:  

    
1.  Mateusz Tadla/ Introduction to Selenium Basic
2.  Mateusz Tadla/ Selenium advanced
    

Mateusz in excellent way have described basic and more advanced Selenium WebDriver details. I want to extend that course and deliver additional project. 

The project contains following items:
    	
*  Cucumber framework
*  Java v.11
*  Maven
*  Selenium WebDriver
*  Hamcrest Matchers
*  JUnit
*  Log4J
*  Cluecumber

    	
This simple BDD test framework operates on web page: **http://5.196.7.235/**
I have prepared following scenarios:
    
  	
* [x]  Test scenario – where I want to present basic Cucumber functions
  	
* [x]  Login scenario – where I want to login to user account
    
* [x]  Purchase scenario – where I want to order men’s Tshirt.
